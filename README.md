## Turborepo & Original Template

This turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a packages manager & was originally bootstrapped from the [with-pnpm](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-pnpm) example.

### Apps and Packages

- `index`: TBD
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
- `config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
